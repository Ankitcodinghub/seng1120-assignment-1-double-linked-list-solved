INTRODUCTION

You are required to build the infrastructure to manipulate data related to text. Your client further specifies that you are to create a class named LinkedList to store individual tokens. The LinkedList will store each token in a Node of the list, using the class string.

ASSIGNMENT TASK

You are required to use a doubly-linked list, as discussed in lectures, to create your own implementation of the LinkedList class. It will use instances of Node to store instances of value_type (in this assignment, each Node will be used to store an instance of string). Your list will be used to store the individual words of a sentence, broken up on the spaces; so each Node will store a single word. For instance, ‚ÄúThe Black Cat‚Äù will add three separate words (‚ÄúThe‚Äù, ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù, ‚ÄúCat‚Äù) to the list.

The LinkedList class will be used by a main program, to be supplied to you, as well as a makefile. You will need to design LinkedList and Node in a way that it communicates seamlessly with the main program and compiles with the makefile also supplied. Please refer to the lecture slides and recordings for guidance on how to implement both classes.

For students in SENG6120, there is an extra requirement:

‚Ä¢ (3.0 marks) Extend the member method void remove(string) inside LinkedList. The extended method pattern matches and then removes all occurrences of an input sentence. For instance, if the linked list contains the sentence ‚ÄúThe black cat was sitting on the black mat that was on the black floor‚Äù, and the input string for remove(string) is ‚Äúon the black‚Äù, then the resulting linked list must be ‚ÄúThe black cat was sitting mat that was floor‚Äù.

For SENG1120 students who want to be challenged more, the above requirement becomes a bonus question, also worth 3.0 marks; however you can still only score a MAXIMUM of 15.0/15.0.

SUBMISSION

Make sure your code works with the files supplied, and DO NOT change them. For marking, we will add the Demo and makefile to the project and compile everything using this makefile, together with your own files. If it does not compile or run, your mark will be zero.

Your submission should be made using the Assignments section of the course Blackboard site. Incorrectly submitted assignments will not be marked. You should provide the .h and .cpp files related to the linked list and node classes, only, plus an assessment item coversheet. Also, if necessary, provide a readme.txt file containing instructions for the marker. Each program file should have a proper header section including your name, course and student number, and your code should be properly documented.

Remember that your code should compile and run correctly using Cygwin. There should be no segmentation faults or memory leaks during or after the execution of the program.

Compress all your files into a single .zip file, using your student number as the filename, and appending ‚Äò_remove‚Äô if you have attempted the bonus section. For example, if your student number is c9876543 and you have implemented remove() (including 6120 students), you would name your submission:

<pre>     c9876543_remove.zip
</pre>
The same student who has NOT attempted the remove() task would simply name their submission:

<pre>     c9876543.zip
</pre>
Submit by clicking in the link that will be created in the Assignments section on Blackboard.

Late submissions are subject to the rules specified in the Course Outline. Finally, a completed Assignment Cover Sheet should accompany your submission.

This assignment is worth 15 marks of your final result for the course (including bonus marks).
